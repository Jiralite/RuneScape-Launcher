# RuneScape Launcher

This is an AppleScript that launches RuneScape with some options. This is **purely** for macOS.

It's not possible to open more than one instance of RuneScape without some sorcery. Did you know that in order to open RuneScape in another language, one has to:

1. Ensure RuneScape is not already running
2. Open the RuneScape launcher
3. Spam-click or try to click & hold the settings button in the bottom left. If you failed, you have to start again.
4. Did you get it open? Congratulations! Now, you may be met with a translucent window. Yes, you read correctly - translucent.

5. Close RuneScape
6. Open RuneScape

That's a lot of steps and it's not particularly friendly. This won't be as much if you only use one account, but many people nowadays use multiple which means closing down all your currently-running instances of RuneScape just to hop to a foreign server. In comparison to Windows, opening the settings there is so much more easier than macOS, but that's Jagex for you.

Moving forward, this AppleScript will help to solve these problems!
